# Restaurant Order Management System

## Description
This project is a Java-based application for managing restaurant orders, designed using the **Builder Pattern** and Object-Oriented Programming principles. It enables the management of customers, orders, waiters, managers, and payments. This project was developed as part of a learning exercise to understand advanced software development concepts.

## User Guide
How It Works
Upon launching the application, users are prompted to log in as either a **Manager** or a **Waiter**. Valid credentials are required for access (like manager1, password1 or waiter1, password1). After logging in, users will see different menus based on their role.

**Managers** can access options to manage tables, menu items, orders, and payments.
**Waiters** can create and manage orders and process payments.
Users navigate the menus by entering the corresponding number for their desired action. The application allows for efficient management of restaurant operations, ensuring a smooth workflow for both managers and waiters.

## Features
- **Table Management**: Add and manage table.
- **Menu Item Management**: Add, edit, and remove menu items by a manager.
- **Order Management**: Waiters can create, modify, and delete orders for tables.
- **Automatic Order Total Calculation**.
- **Payment Management**: Track payment statuses (Paid or Unpaid).
